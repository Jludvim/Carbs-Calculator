# Carbs Calculator

Carbs Calculator is an app developed to facilitate carbs counting. Chiefly for personal use.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
The app takes some data, and makes some math operations that otherwise should be either manually performed
or merely estimated.
It has three chief functionalities so far. All of which require the use of a kitchen scale.

 1. Determining the amount of carbs a portion has, knowing: 
                -the carbs in 100g that food has
                -the portion size (g)

2. Determining a portion size, knowing:
                -the amount of carbs in 100g that food has (g)
                -the desired final carb count (g)

 3. Determining the amount of carbs a food has in 100g, knowing:
                -a serving size
                -amount of carbs per such serving 
                (both generally specified in most packages)
    
 4. Adding a serie of (g) food values with a specific carbs rate value in 100g
    Allowing cooking and preparing complex dishes, or else integrating different values for a personal meal


This app is in its first versions.
It is quite likely that more functionalities will be added, and many errors will be corrected.
